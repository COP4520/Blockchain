Scalability is a huge problem in blockchain technologies, with many resources targetting this very issue. In this project, our team will be attempting to research and experiment viable solutions for the blockchain scalability problem. This project beings with a traditional proof-of-work blockchain implementation to better our understanding of the blockchain and consensus. As development continued, we realized that a blockchain based on the proof-of-work consensus mechanism was not very compatible with parallelization. Thus, we made the conversion to a proof-of-stake blockchain, which solves many of the problems with proof-of-work, with minor tradeoffs. In the final phases of this research, we further experimented with sharding on our proof-of-stake blockchain to gain a better understanding of distributed processing and better ensure decentralization throughout the blockchain.
